# HtmlCssBook
So this project and or repository is my project in my coding book which as you can see is based off of HTML and CSS. 

For the future I am hoping to extend this book into the next book after this which is Javascript and Jquery and be able to extend my knowledge when it comes to front end.

I will only put the exercises in these repos and my new animation and other things will go on the other repos.

The third book one based of the back end "PHP and MySQL" will be coming out in september so I am going to hustle sense both attract my attention and I want to learn them so that I am able to start working with back end, I know there is a way to be able to use javascript in the backend as well but I decided that I would like to learn PHP for that and of course MySQL for databases.

Hope You Enjoy My Journey To Becoming A Full Stack Developer!! ðŸ˜†
