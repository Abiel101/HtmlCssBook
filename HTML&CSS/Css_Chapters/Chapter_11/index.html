            <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. this includes dissolved materials form Earth's curst
              as well as materials released form organisms. The most important component of seawater that influence life forms 
              are salinity, temperature dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These elements
              vary in their composition as well as their influence on marine life.
