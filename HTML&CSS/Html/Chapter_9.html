    <h1>Adding a Flash Animation "not supported on this browser"</h1>
    <!--Note that when using this flash can still be used 
          but you really need to be careful with what browsers because not all support it. And if i do use it for something for
          some king og animation using "Javascript" then I need to make sure I leave text linked to it just incase the browser doesn't support the animation and 
          with the description people will be able to tell what there supposed to be in 
          that area-->
            <div id="bird"> This is Supposed to be an animation of a bird taking a shower using flash 
               <br> "flash is probably not supported in this browser anymore but its good to know that I can use it" 
            <br> (and it will use javascript which is most commonly used now a days.) </div>

        <h1>Adding A Flash Video To Your Page</h1>
<!--WHEN ITS ADDING A FLASH VIDEO ITS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT YOU NEED TO USE A JAVASCRIPT SCRIPT SO YOU CAN USE IT 
AND MAKE SURE THAT ITS REFERING TO THE CORRECT "ID" sense it used the "id" in a div to replace the text with the video...-->
        <div id="snow"><p>
            A video of a puppy playing in the snow
        </p></div><!--Dont forget that there is a chance that flash wont work mainly becaus there are many browsers that dont support it sometiems so just watch out for that and check that if itll work.-->
